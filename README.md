# Mechanical Engineering Capstone Project: Practice of Mechanical Engineering

## Course Project Overview
The Practice of Mechanical Engineering course is the capstone of the undergraduate Mechanical Engineering program at National Taiwan University, 2020. This project involves designing, manufacturing, analyzing, testing, and verifying a propeller-driven autonomous car. The car is engineered to track lines, control speed, and overtake other vehicles within specified budget, size, and weight constraints.

## Contribution
My role in this project included designing the propeller and the overall vehicle structure, such as the chassis and braking system, utilizing Solidworks and AutoCAD. I also manufactured the components including 3D printing, laser cutting and other hands-on skills. Additionally, I was actively engaging in control and software testing, experimentation, and analytical discussions.
